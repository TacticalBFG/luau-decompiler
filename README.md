# luau-decompiler
decompiles luau :)

# If you dont know how to use this dont ask me
This is for non-experienced developers to have an excuse "oh wow look we can decompile luau now too!"

Really this thing barely works, it gets you a good idea of the script but won't give you an exact result since I can't perform witchcraft

# How to use
This is literally just a Lua script and a c++ file

Step 1:
  Transfer my functions from my c++ file to your c++ file!

Step 2:
  Make my functions compatible with your exploit. Hopefully you should already know how to do this

Step 3:
  Add the functions to your exploit
  
Step 4:
  Execute the decompiler script ONCE after injection.
  
Step 5:
  To decompile a script, simply type "result = decompile(workspace.WhateverScript)"
  The decompiled script will be returned as a string and you can print it or do whatever
  
Have fun
